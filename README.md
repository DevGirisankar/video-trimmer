# video-trimmer

This project shows how to trim a video using ```AVAssetExportSession```

- [x] Video preview 
- [x] Select video from photo library or record a new one (using ```PHPickerViewController```  for new iOS versions and ```UIImagePickerController``` for old iOS versions)
- [x] Trim video and save video to Photos Library
- [x] Now the maximum time of video is limited to 2.5 minutes, can change it using ```trimmerView.maxDuration = 200``` 

Thanks to ```PryntTrimmerView``` for trim view
